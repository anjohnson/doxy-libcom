/**

 * @brief This is an extended replacement for the Posix exit and atexit
 * routines, which also provides a pointer argument to pass to the exit
 * handlers.
 * 
 * This facility was created because of problems on vxWorks and windows
 * with the implementation of atexit, i.e. neither of these systems
 * implement exit and atexit according to the POSIX standard.
